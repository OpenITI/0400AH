90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Eric van Lit; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally annotated by Eric, validated by Gowaart.
        See readme file for Eric's comments on the quality of the digital text.
        Gowaart heavily edited the previously tagged structure, sometimes based
        on contents rather than on the edition, where headers often look to be
        the same size. Also cleaned up the digital text slightly by deleting
        footnotes by way of regex.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I heavily changed the structure of this text. All
        the person’s names were tagged as headers and I replaced them with ### $BIO_MAN$
        (since they are biographies), and showed their subsections (which were also
        tagged as headers) with #:~section:. Then I replaced the ### $ tags for book
        names with its complete format ### $DIC_BIB$. Now I think the text has a clearer
        structure: All the person’s names are tagged with ### $BIO_MAN$, the subsections
        of the person’s names are tagged with #:~section:, and the books written by each
        person are tagged with ### $DIC_BIB$, and the header tags (### |) are just used
        for titles. I added a few blank headers to show the change of subject matters
        (since the text has a complicated structure in some parts shifting from one
        subject to another and then turning back to the main subject). I changed the
        levelling of some headers, and tagged some untagged name entries. I added one
        title in square brackets in PageV00P101. 2- The annotator writes that he has
        deleted the footnotes by RegEx. As far as I can see the text, it seems that some
        of the footnotes should have been the parts quoted from the margin of the
        manuscripts, and not editorial stuff. I’m not sure if this should be considered
        footnote and if it should be deleted. Just like PageV00P218-220 in which a
        section has been entered into the text from the margin of one of the manuscripts
        and has disrupted the consistency of the text. To maintain the consistency of
        the text, the best solution that comes to my mind is that we transfer all such
        parts to the end of the text (first we need to recall such sections from an
        older version before deletion).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
