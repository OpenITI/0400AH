90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK001218 (identical to Shamela0006997) is a
    digitization of   Sāmarrā'ī's edition of two risālas by Rummānī
    (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4771444716),   which includes, in addition
    to the Manāzil (sic) al-ḥurūf,  also a second risāla, Risālat al-Ḥudūd.
    PV extracted the Manāzil al-ḥurūf from this edition and annotated it.
    (The Risālat al-Ḥudūd from the same edition is  already in the corpus as
    0384AbuHasanRummani.RisalatHudud.JK006988-ara1) A pdf of the original
    edition was not found,  the text was compared with another edition
    (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4771087611),  which is slightly different
    but shows at least  that the text is complete.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 197
