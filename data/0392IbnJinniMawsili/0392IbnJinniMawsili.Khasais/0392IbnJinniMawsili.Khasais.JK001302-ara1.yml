90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela and JK versions are based on the same
    edition. Worldcat-link has a different publisher, but the one in PDF is
    likely a reprint (same editor). I annotated the JK version as it is
    cleaner than the Shamela version (which also includes the indexes). I
    formatted the poetry automatically, but the closing brackets at the end
    of a poetry line is still present. Qur'anic verse markers also present.
    The edition does not clearly mark differences in hierarchy of sections,
    so the ones I have introduced are based on content (basically, any
    section not starting with "bab" is not first level). From the short bits
    I've read the text reproduction is of high quality, although punctuation
    is a bit spotty.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 1845, 8311,
    8774, 10846, 13416, 13912, 14120
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 4869, 5077, 11175
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
