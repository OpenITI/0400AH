90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was edited together with Ibn Bābawayh's
    ʿIqāb al-aʿmāl; PV separated these two texts (see
    0381IbnBabawayh.CiqabAcmal.Shia001138BK2-ara1) 1- HRH used a different
    edition for collation. This edition has a few extra titles ("bāb"). HRH
    indicated them with blank headers since they are useful for the
    structure of the text.  2- Two other editions of the text that are
    accessible on the internet can be found here:
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2100 and
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2542.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
