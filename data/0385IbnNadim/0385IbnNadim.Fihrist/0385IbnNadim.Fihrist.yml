90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Devin Stewart ("Editing the Fihrist", 
    Journal of Abbasid Studies 1, pp. 173-178)
    reviews the scholarship on the Fihrist. 
    His main points on the history of the text:
    * The original manuscript was written for a patron
      (perhaps the vizier ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī b. al-Jarrāḥ)
    * The autograph manuscript was buried, unused, in some library
      in Baghdād until it was found and used by al-Wazīr al-Maghribī
      (d. 418/1027), who added many additions to the autograph.
      The autograph was later discovered by Yāqūt, who distinguished 
      between the main text of the Fihrist and the additions ("ziyādāt")
      by al-Wazīr al-Maghribī; and by Ibn al-Najjār and others. 
      The autograph itself is lost (perhaps in the Mongol conquest of 1258).
    * The oldest surviving copy of the autograph was made probably in the 11th C, 
      and survives in two halves:
      the first part is in the Chester Beatty library in Dublin (MS 3315),
      the second in Istanbul (MS Şehid Ali Paşa 1934). 
      The copyist notes at the end of each section that it was 
      "copied from and checked against the author's dustūr."
      He also tried to reproduce the format of the original,
      including layout and blanks left by Ibn al-Nadīm in the autograph.
      This copy (called by Ayman Fuad Sayyid "al-Aṣl") carries notes by, among others,
      al-Maqrīzī (in both halves; one dated 824), and a certain Aḥmad b. ʿAlī 
      (dated 835, in Damascus). 
      Probably in Syria, the manuscript was somehow cut into two halves:
      the first half was given as a waqf to the Mosque of Acre in the 18th C
      and bought by Chester Beatty between 1914 and 1930;
      the second half was already in Istanbul in 1093/1682, and ended up in the
      Şehid Ali Paşa library. 
      The manuscript, which originally consisted of 330 folios (33 quires of 10 folios;
      Chester Beatty: quires 1-14, Şehid Ali Paşa: quires 15-33)
      has a number of gaps:
      - the title page in the Chester Beatty ms is not original
      - the entire second quire is missing
      - the entire fourteenth quire is missing 
        (end of the Chester Beatty ms., on Muʿtazilī theologians);
        part of this lacuna cannot be restored from other sources.
      - the title page in the Şehid Ali Paşa ms. is not original either
      - two folios at the end were copied in another hand, probably 
        from Köprülü 1135, to make up for the loss of these pages. 
    * another copy of the autograph was made in 600/1203 by a Yūsuf b. Muhannā b. Manṣūr;
      it survives as Köprülü 1135 and was probably used by Ibn al-Qifṭī.
    * another copy, completed in 627/1230, is now in Paris (BnF ar. 4457)
      and represents the text of the Fihrist with the interpolations 
      of al-Wazīr al-Maghribī. It was probably used by Ibn Khallikān. 
    * another copy of the autograph, in three volumes, survives in Rajistan, India
      ("the Tonk manuscript"); it does not include the additions by al-Wazīr al-Maghribī. 
    Editions and translations: 
    * ed. Gustav Flügel, Leipzig 1871-2: uses the Paris ms. BnF ar. 4457 as its base.
      In OpenITI as GRAR000030.
    * ed. Johann Fück: did not complete his edition but did a lot of work
    * tr. Bayard Dodge, New York 1970: based on the two halves of the Aṣl ms.
    * ed. Reza Tajaddud 1971: based on the two halves of the Aṣl ms. in addition to 
      other mss.; inconsistently distinguishes between the text of Ibn al-Nadīm
      and al-Wazīr al-Maghribī. In OpenITI as Shia003355.
    * ed. Ibrāhīm Ramaḍān, Beirut 1997: pirated copy of the Tajaddud ed.?? 
      In OpenITI as JK000557 and Shamela0007642.
    * ed. Muṣṭafā al-Shuwaymī, Tunis 1985: based on the two halves of the Aṣl ms.
    * Ayman Fuad Sayyid, London 2009: clearly distinguishes between the text of Ibn al-Nadīm
      and al-Wazīr al-Maghribī (the latter are put between square brackets).
      Material from other sources/manuscripts are between pointed brackets.
