90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela0010428 contains ʿAbd al-Salām Hārūn's edition
    of two collections of small works attributed to al-Jāḥiẓ:  1. vols. 1-2:
    edition of a majmūʿa ms. in the Dāmād Ibrāhīm library in Turkey (no.
    949), which carries no date but is dated by the editor to the 6th C AH
    based on the handwriting. Edition based on the microfilm in the Arab
    League's Maʿhad al-Makhṭūṭāt in Cairo (no. F943) 2. vols. 3-4: edition
    of another majmūʿa, an anthology of sections from  Jāḥiẓ's texts by
    ʿUbayd Allāh b. Ḥassān (unknown; probably 4th C. AH, see intro vol. 3 p.
    13f.).  Edition based on three manuscripts (see vol. 3, introduction,
    pp. 7-12):
          - B: British Museum, dated 1294/1877
          - M: Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya, Adab Taymūr no. 19, copy dated
    1315AH (from an ancient manuscript dated 403AH!)

    1323AH (unclear from which manuscript this text was edited) NB: the
    texts in volumes 3 and 4 are only extracts of rasā'il, not the full

    - Vol 4, P 49, part of the Parag 1 missing (added by PV);
    - Vol 4, P 123, part of Parag2,3 missing (added by PV).
    - Vol 1, P 235, Parag 5 is repeated (could not find this problem).
    - Vol 2, P 75, parag 2 is redundant (removed by PV).
    - Redundant question marks in Vol 4, P 19, parag 2; P 20, Parag 2; P
    21 Parag 2 & 3. (removed by PV)
    - Very small Typos like “قال” instead of “یقول” in Vol 1, P 187, L
    14 (corrected by PV).
