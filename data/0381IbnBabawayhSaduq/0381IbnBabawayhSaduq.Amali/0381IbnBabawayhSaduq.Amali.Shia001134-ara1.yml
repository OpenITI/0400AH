90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- A lot of English characters in the text. 2- There
    is a tag like “NoteV00P059N03” in the text. I don’t know what it is.
    3-Some numbers are typed in Arabic instead of English. 4- Another
    edition of the text that is accessible on the internet can be found
    here: https://mktba.net/library.php?id=6845
