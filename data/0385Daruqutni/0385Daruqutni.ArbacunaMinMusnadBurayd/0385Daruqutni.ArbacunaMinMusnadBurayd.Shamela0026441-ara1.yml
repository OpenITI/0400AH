90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    interred into the text (and that is the correct pagination for the book;
    the automatic pagination is wrong). I just untagged them. They must be
    deleted and the automatic pagination must be corrected. 2- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
