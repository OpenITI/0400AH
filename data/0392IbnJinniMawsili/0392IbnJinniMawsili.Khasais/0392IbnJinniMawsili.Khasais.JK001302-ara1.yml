90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela and JK versions are based on the same edition. Worldcat-link has a different publisher, but the one in PDF is likely a reprint (same editor). I annotated the JK version as it is cleaner than the Shamela version (which also includes the indexes). I formatted the poetry automatically, but the closing brackets at the end of a poetry line is still present. Qur'anic verse markers also present. The edition does not clearly mark differences in hierarchy of sections, so the ones I have introduced are based on content (basically, any section not starting with "bab" is not first level). From the short bits I've read the text reproduction is of high quality, although punctuation is a bit spotty.
