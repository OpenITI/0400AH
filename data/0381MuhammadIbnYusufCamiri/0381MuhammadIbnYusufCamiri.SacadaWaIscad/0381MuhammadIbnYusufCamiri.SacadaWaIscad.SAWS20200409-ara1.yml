90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: LMN
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PS-Amiri; forms part of the Arabic gnomological texts
    that were transcribed for SAWS-project ("Sharing Ancient Wisdoms"); see
    https://ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/; text was manually transcribed by LMN for
    SAWS;  only minimal (first-level) structural tagging has been added;
    revision of marginal notes required
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 4340, 5181, 5182
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The PDF link provided by the annotator was removed. I found the new link (which might be a reprint), and collated the text with it. So, now, first-level headers are typed. Levelling of the headers is corrected. Untagged headers are tagged. Body text is separated from the titles.
