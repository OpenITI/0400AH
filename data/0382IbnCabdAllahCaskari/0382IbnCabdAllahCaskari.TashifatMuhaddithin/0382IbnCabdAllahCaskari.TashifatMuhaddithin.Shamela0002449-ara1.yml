90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Shamla version lacked the third volume, so I
        copied it from the Shia version which is exactly the same edition (with
        Maxim’s permission). I also did this for PageV02P593-608 that were
        missing in Shamela version. 2- The text did not have any automatic tags
        except a few unnecessary ones. 3- The first volume has a descriptive
        table of contents which cannot be used for annotation. However, it might
        be helpful for understanding the structure of the text. 4- The editorial
        section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
