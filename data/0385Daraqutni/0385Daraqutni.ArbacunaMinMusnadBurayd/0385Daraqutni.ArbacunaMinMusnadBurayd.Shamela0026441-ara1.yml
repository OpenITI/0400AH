90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    interred into the text (and that is the correct pagination for the book;
    the automatic pagination is wrong). I just untagged them. They must be
    deleted and the automatic pagination must be corrected. 2- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
