90#VERS#COMMENT##: This version contains geographical tags
    by Masoumeh Seydi, for encoding routes and regions.
    This version used to be named 0390Muqaddasi.AhsanTaqasim.Shamela0023696-ara1;
    PV renamed it and removed MSG's tags from the Shamela version, 
    which will become the primary version.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I reduced the levelling of the headers in page 10-61
    by one, and deleted the editorial section. 2- There are a lot of Latin words and
    geographical tags in the text.
