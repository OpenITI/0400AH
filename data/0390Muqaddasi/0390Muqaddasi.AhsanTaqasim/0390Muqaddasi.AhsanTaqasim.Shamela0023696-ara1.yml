90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Masoumeh Seydi; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Annotated by unknown, validated by Gowaart. Text has
    been extensively pre-tagged with geographical data and notes referring
    to footnotes. The .completed version does not contain this material. I
    have not touched these tags. When re-evaluating I noticed that something
    strange happened with the metadata which was all gone from the mARkdown
    file, so I have pasted this back from the .completed file.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I reduced the levelling of the headers in page 10-61
    by one, and deleted the editorial section. 2- There are a lot of Latin words and
    geographical tags in the text. 3- There is an MSG20191024-ara1 file in the
    folder. I Just removed its mARkdown extension, but I didnâ€™t change anything else
    in this text since it seems to be a personal version.
