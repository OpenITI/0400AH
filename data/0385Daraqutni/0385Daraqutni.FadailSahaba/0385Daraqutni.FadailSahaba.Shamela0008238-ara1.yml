90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The page numbers at the top of the pages are
    interred into the text (and that is the correct pagination for the book;
    the automatic pagination is wrong). I just untagged them. They must be
    deleted and the automatic pagination must be corrected. 2- The edition I
    used for collation is exactly the same as the Shamela edition. However,
    the numbers of Hadiths are different for no apparent reason.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
