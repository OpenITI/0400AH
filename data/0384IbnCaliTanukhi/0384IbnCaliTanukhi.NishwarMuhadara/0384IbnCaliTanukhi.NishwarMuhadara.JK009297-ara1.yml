90#VERS#COMMENT##: This version only contains volumes 1-3 and 8 of the Shālijī
    edition;
    volumes 4-7 are not based on any manuscript but contain anecdotes
    gathered by the editor from quotations in later sources.
    The text file missed the first couple of pages;
    PV supplied those from the Masaha version and marked the end of the
    insertion with this tag: `###END_OF_INSERTION###`
    All paratextual elements (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    WARNING: another version of this text may have more developed annotation!
