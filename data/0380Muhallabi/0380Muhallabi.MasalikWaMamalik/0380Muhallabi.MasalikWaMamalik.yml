90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A geographical work, written for the Fāṭimid caliph al-ʿAzīz bi-Allāh
    (r. 365-386/975-996). The work itself is lost, but part of it is known from
    citations in a manuscript in the Ambrosiana library, written by an unknown
    author al-Kilāʿī (5th C AH) and edited by Ṣāliḥ al-Munajjid. 
    In 2006, Taysīr Khalaf published a reconstructed version of the Kitāb al-ʿAzīzī,
    based on quotations in the Ambrosiana fragment and other fragments. In the introduction,
    he writes  (p. 18) that he organized the fragments following the structure of Abū al-Fīdā's
    Taqwīm al-Buldān.
