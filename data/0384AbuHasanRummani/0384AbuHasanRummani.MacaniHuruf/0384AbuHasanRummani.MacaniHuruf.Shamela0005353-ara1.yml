90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book “معاني الحروف” consists of two manuscripts: “نسخة القدس” and “نسخة إسطمبول” (which contain different subjects). This text (Shamela version, which is the only version on the repository) just contains the “إسطمبول” manuscript. So, we need to find the text of the “قدس” manuscript and add it to this file (or maybe as a separate file to the repository). 2- Pages 169-175 of the PDF are missing in the text. 3- Another edition of the text that is accessible on the internet can be found here: https://ia902505.us.archive.org/4/items/almoamltv_gmail_20140519/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81.pdf
