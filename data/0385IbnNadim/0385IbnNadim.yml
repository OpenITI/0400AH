    "Abu ’l-Farad̲j̲ Muḥammad b. Abī Yaʿḳūb Isḥāḳ al-Warrāḳ al-Bag̲h̲dādī , 
    author of the well-known Kitāb al-Fihrist , an “Index” of Arabic books, 
    completed according to the author’s own statement 
    (p. 2, line 12; 38, 28; 87, 19; cf. also 132, 7 and 219, 7) 
    in 377/987-8. Of his life very little is known. 
    He died on 20 S̲h̲aʿbān 385/17 September 995 according to Ibn al-Nad̲j̲d̲j̲ar, 
    D̲h̲ayl Taʾrīk̲h̲ Bag̲h̲dād (see Flügel’s edition, i, XII, n. 2) 
    or according to others in 388/998 (see Ibn Ḥad̲j̲ar, Lisān al-Mīzān , v, 72, 
    where 38 is apparently a misprint)".
    NB: Ibn al-Najjār, whose text is lost but whose biography of Ibn al-Nadīm
    was quoted by al-Ṣafadī, al-Maqrīzī and Ibn Ḥajar, gives his death date as
    20 Shaʿbān 380 / 12 November 990, not 385! (see the introduction to
    Ayman Fuad Sayyid's edition, p. 18)
    Devin Stewart ("Editing the Fihrist", Journal of Abbasid Studies 14, p. 167)
    reviews the scholarship on Ibn al-Nadīm's name
    and concludes "Ibn al-Nadīm" was his family name, and that he
    himself nor his father was likely a nadīm. 
    As for his date of birth, Stewart (p. 168) agrees with Polosin that 
    Ibn al-Nadīm was born and grew up in Mosul and moved to Baghdād
    only later, probably in the late 340s/950s.
