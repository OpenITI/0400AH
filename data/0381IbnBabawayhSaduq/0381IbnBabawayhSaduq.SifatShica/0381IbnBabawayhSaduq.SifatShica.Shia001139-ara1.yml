90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The text consists of 71 Hadith and does not have
    anything that needs to be tagged. 2-There is no data in METADATA section
    to show which edition is used in Editpro text. However, a typed version
    of this edition can be found in this address:
    http://fazellankarani.com/persian/library/hadith/last/page/8 (It is not
    a PDF. I just mention this address so that the information in the
    METADATA section can be completed. I used a different edition for
    collation whose PDF is accessible in VERS#LINKS). 3- Two other editions
    of the text that are accessible on the internet and a manuscript can be
    found here: http://www.ar.islamic-sources.com/book/%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%A7%D8
