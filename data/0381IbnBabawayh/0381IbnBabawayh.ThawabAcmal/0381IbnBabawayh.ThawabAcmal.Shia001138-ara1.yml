90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used a different edition for collation. This
    edition has a few extra titles. I showed them with blank headers since
    they are useful for the structure of the text (I didn’t add the titles
    because I’m not allowed to add anything to the text. I just showed their
    places in the text). 2- Two other editions of the text that are
    accessible on the internet can be found here:
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2100 and
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2542. 3- I made a “URI change
    suggestion” for this text because the text consists of two different
    books: “ثواب الأعمال” and “عقاب الأعمال” which are bound together in
    this edition. In some other editions (like the second link above) they
    are bound separately.
