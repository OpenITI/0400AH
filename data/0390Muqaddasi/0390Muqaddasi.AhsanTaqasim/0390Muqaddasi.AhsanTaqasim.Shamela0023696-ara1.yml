90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained extensive tagging
    by Masoumeh Seydi (routes and regions) for her PhD research.
    PV created a copy of the file containing these tags
    (0390Muqaddasi.AhsanTaqasim.MSG20230908-ara1) and
    removed the additional tags in the Shamela file.
    Annotated by unknown, validated by Gowaart. 
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I reduced the levelling of the headers in page 10-61
    by one, and deleted the editorial section. 2- There are a lot of Latin words and
    geographical tags in the text.
    PV removed the Latin words and other remnants of footnotes.
