90#AUTH#COMMENT##: The author is best known in Western academia as al-Muqaddasī
    (the nisba derived from al-Bayt al-Muqaddas, a name for Jerusalem);
    in the Arabic-speaking world, his nisba is usually transcribed as al-Maqdisī
    (derived from another variant of Jerusalem in Arabic, Bayt al-Maqdis).
    Since the author himself only uses "Bayt al-Maqdis" in his own text,
    and never "al-Bayt al-Muqaddas", it is safe to assume that he himself 
    would have pronounced his name "al-Maqdisī".
