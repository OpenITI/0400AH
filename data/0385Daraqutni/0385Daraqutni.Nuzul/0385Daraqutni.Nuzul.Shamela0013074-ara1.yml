90#VERS#COMMENT##: folio numbers tagged as paragraph with one single
    hashtag. numerals tagged as paragraph with one single hashtag. missing
    numerals: 14, 40. text line removed from header and tagged as new
    paragraph with one single hashtag.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All the headers were first-level. I added a part of the text to two first-level headers, and changed the levelling of other headers accordingly. The structure of the text is now very clear. The text consists of three variations on a single hadith about the time of God’s descent (nuzūl) to forgive the sinners. 2- PARATEXT added. 3- number 41 in page 124 is missing.
