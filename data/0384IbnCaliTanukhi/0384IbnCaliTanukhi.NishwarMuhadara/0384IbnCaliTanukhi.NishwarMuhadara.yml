    ʿAbbūd al-Shālijī edited the text in eight volumes:
    * vol. 1: juzʾ 1 (from BnF ms. ar. 3482 and
      and a ms. from the Murad Molla library in Istanbul)
    * vol. 2: juzʾ 2 (from the BnF and Murad Molla mss.)
    * vol. 3: unknown juzʾ (from a ms. in the Taymūriyya collection)
    * vols. 4-7: collected from citations in other sources
      (see the editor's introduction in vol. 1 for a full list;
      these volumes can be found in the OpenITI corpus under 1416CabbudShaliji.NishwarQuotes)
    * vol. 8: juzʾ 8 (from BM ms. Or. 9586)
    "According to Yāqūt’s Irshād, Tanūkhī’s Nishwār was made up of 11 volumes, 
    each of which started with an introduction. Moreover, among the manuscripts 
    available to the editor ʿAbbūd al-Shāljī is a British Museum library copy 
    whose colophon specifies that it constitutes part 8 [of the Nishwār] 
    and mentions a part 9 to come, which lends credibility to Yāqūt’s count. 
    As well as this British museum copy for part 8, al-Shāljī also had MS copies 
    which he identified as parts 1 and 2, and another MS copy which included an unknown part. 
    This unknown part he published in his edition as vol. 3. 
    (I should specify that with a complete MS of any part of the Nishwār, 
    it is fairly easy to identify what constitute a whole “part” since Tanūkhī 
    indeed prefaces each of his volumes with a introduction, 
    and tells us so in his very first introduction, that to part 1.)
    So to sum up, Shāljī had four volumes that very likely come from Tanūkhī, 
    which he published as vol. 1, 2, 3 and 8. 
    But because of the mention of 11 volumes in Yāqūt and the existence 
    of a part 8 according to the MS, without any trace of the missing parts 
    between [3] and 8 or beyond 8, Shāljī took it upon himself to hunt for the missing stories.
    So he combed through books by Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, al-Ṣābiʾ, 
    Yāqūt, Ibn Khallikān, and others known to quote Tanūkhī often, 
    and looked for stories attributed to al-Muḥassin al-Tanūkhī 
    (under many possible versions of his name) or to his son 
    that were absent from al-Faraj baʿd al-shidda or the known Nishwār. 
    He took comfort, as maybe we should, in the fact that in quite a few cases, 
    such stories are indeed found in the known Nishwār. 
    But then he inserts all the others into his edition of the Nishwār, 
    to make up volumes 4, 5, 6, and 7, signaling his additions 
    with the indication of the source at the end of each piece. 
    But [volumes 4 to 7] of the Nishwār as they presently exist in the edition (...) 
    have no MS precedent and are a reconstruction by the editor." (Zina Maleh, personal communication)
