90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Eric van Lit; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally annotated by Eric, validated by Gowaart.
    See readme file for Eric's comments on the quality of the digital text.
    Gowaart heavily edited the previously tagged structure, sometimes based
    on contents rather than on the edition, where headers often look to be
    the same size. Also cleaned up the digital text slightly by deleting
    footnotes by way of regex.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I heavily changed the structure of this text. All the person’s names were tagged as headers and I replaced them with ### $BIO_MAN$ (since they are biographies), and showed their subsections (which were also tagged as headers) with #:~section:. Then I replaced the ### $ tags for book names with its complete format ### $DIC_BIB$. Now I think the text has a clearer structure: All the person’s names are tagged with ### $BIO_MAN$, the subsections of the person’s names are tagged with #:~section:, and the books written by each person are tagged with ### $DIC_BIB$, and the header tags (### |) are just used for titles. I added a few blank headers to show the change of subject matters (since the text has a complicated structure in some parts shifting from one subject to another and then turning back to the main subject). I changed the levelling of some headers, and tagged some untagged name entries. I added one title in square brackets in PageV00P101. 2- The annotator writes that he has deleted the footnotes by RegEx. As far as I can see the text, it seems that some of the footnotes should have been the parts quoted from the margin of the manuscripts, and not editorial stuff. I’m not sure if this should be considered footnote and if it should be deleted. Just like PageV00P218-220 in which a section has been entered into the text from the margin of one of the manuscripts and has disrupted the consistency of the text. To maintain the consistency of the text, the best solution that comes to my mind is that we transfer all such parts to the end of the text (first we need to recall such sections from an older version before deletion).
