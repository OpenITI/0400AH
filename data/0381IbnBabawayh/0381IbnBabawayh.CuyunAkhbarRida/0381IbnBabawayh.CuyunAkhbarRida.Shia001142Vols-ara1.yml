90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used the first link in VERS#LINKS for collation which is exactly the same edition as the Shia edition; but it leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the contents. So, I provided the second link which is a reprint of the first one. 2- The two volumes of the book appear in reverse order in Editpro text. First, we see the second volume and after that the first volume appears. The number of the volumes in pagination must also be corrected after changing the place of the two volumes.
