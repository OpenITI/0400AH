90#VERS#COMMENT##: Poetry and paragraphs are not always tagged properly. The
    Shamela version
    was cleaner, but it was a version that was mostly had few lines per page
    because of
    extensive commentary in footnotes. Also a page was missing towards the end.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 332, 432, 464,
    539, 764, 811, 815, 877, 936, 940, 975, 1299, 1441, 1598, 1660, 1722, 1725,
    1879, 1969, 2111, 2465, 2488, 2549, 2555, 2559, 2607, 2620, 2667, 2703
