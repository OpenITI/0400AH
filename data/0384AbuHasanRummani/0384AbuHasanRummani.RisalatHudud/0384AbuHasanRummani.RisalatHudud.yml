90#BOOK#COMMENT##: Both versions in the corpus (JK006988 and
    Shamela0006981)
    are based on the same edition of the text, in which the Risālat al-
    Ḥudūd
    was published together with the Manāzil al-ḥurūf (by the same
    author).
    This joint publication is also in JK and Shamela (JK001218 and
    Shamela 0006997),
    which was removed from the corpus. See
