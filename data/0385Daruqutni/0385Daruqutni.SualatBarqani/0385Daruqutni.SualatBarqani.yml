90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A list of questions about the trustworthiness
    of ḥadīth transmitters (al-jarḥ wa-al-taʿdīl).
    The questions are presented as being asked by al-Barqānī
    to his teacher al-Dāraquṭnī. 
    There are currently two editions in the corpus: 
    * ed. ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Aḥmad al-Qashqarī, Lahore 1404 (JK000506): 
      based on a majmuʿ manuscript in the Aḥmad III library in Istanbul
      (no. 624/21, 16 pages); the manuscript is complete,
      but the editor edited only the first two parts of the text, not the third.
    * ed. Magdī Fatḥī al-Sayyid Ibrāhīm, Cairo (Maktabat al-Qur'ān): 1409/1989
      (Shamela0001060, Shia002080): 
      based on a manuscript in the Dār al-Kutub in Cairo (majmuʿ no. 1558/ḥadīth, folios 539-546),
      and a 20th-C copy of the text in that manuscript (Cairo, Dār al-Kutub no. 25580/B); 
      these copies contain many ijāzāt and samāʿāt. 
      This edition contains only the third part of the book.
    A more recent edition combines the three parts but has not been digitized yet
    (ed. Abu ʿUmar Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Azharī, 
    Su'ālāt Abī Bakr al-Barqānī lil-imām Abī al-Ḥasan al-Dāraquṭnī 
    fī al-jarḥ wa-al-taʿdīl wa-ʿilal al-ḥadīth,
    Cairo (al-Fārūq al-Ḥadītha): 1427/2006)
    (for more on the different editions: see the introduction to al-Azharī's edition, pp. 27f.)
