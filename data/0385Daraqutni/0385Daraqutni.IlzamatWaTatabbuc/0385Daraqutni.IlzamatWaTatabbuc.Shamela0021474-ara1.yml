90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The titles of the two books (i.e. “الإلزامات” and
    “التتبع”) must be added in front of the first-level blank headers. 2- In
    the first book, the numbers at the beginning of paragraphs are missing.
    3- There is a descriptive table of contents at the end of the book which
    cannot be used for tagging the text; however it is useful for
    understanding the structure and contents of the text. 4- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
