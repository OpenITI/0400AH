90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a digital copy of Tayseer Khalaf's reconstruction of
    al-Muhallabī's text. The text is reconstructed from quotations of the book
    he found in Abu al-Fidā's Taqwīm al-Buldān (201 quotations according to PV's
    count),
    Yāqut's Muʿjam al-Buldān (47 quotations),
    Ibn al-ʿAdīm's Bughyat al-Ṭalab (6 quotations),
    the Ambrosiana fragment of Muḥammad b. al-Ḥasan al-Kalāʿī (d. 404/1013)'s work
    (3 quotations; Milano, Bibl. Ambrosiana ms. NF G3),
    and a number of other sources (?).
    The compiler ordered the quotations following the order of the Taqwīm al-Buldān.
    The source of each quotatin is found in the footnotes.
    The longest fragment is al-Kalāʿī's citation of al-Muhallabī's description of
    Jerusalem, which takes up about 12 pages in the edition.
    HRH tagged the structure of the text.
    PV removed the editorial sections and leftover html tags.
