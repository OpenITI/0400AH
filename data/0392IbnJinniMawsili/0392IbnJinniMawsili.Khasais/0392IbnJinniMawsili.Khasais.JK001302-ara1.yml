90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shamela and JK versions are based on the same
        edition. Worldcat-link has a different publisher, but the one in PDF is
        likely a reprint (same editor). I annotated the JK version as it is
        cleaner than the Shamela version (which also includes the indexes). I
        formatted the poetry automatically, but the closing brackets at the end
        of a poetry line is still present. Qur'anic verse markers also present.
        The edition does not clearly mark differences in hierarchy of sections,
        so the ones I have introduced are based on content (basically, any
        section not starting with "bab" is not first level). From the short bits
        I've read the text reproduction is of high quality, although punctuation
        is a bit spotty.
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 1845, 8311,
        8774, 10846, 13416, 13912, 14120
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 4869, 5077, 11175
       NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
