90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of the Paris ms. (BnF 4821) of a
    Maslama's additional chapter to his notes on Ptolemy's Planisphaerium.
    Transcription by Paul Hullmeine (https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/team/38).
    Text digitized by the Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus project at the
    Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften. The text was converted to
    OpenITI mARkdown by PV. The text contains numerous tables and images
    (diagrams).  The tables have been converted into markdown (for cells
    spanning multiple columns, PV used the approach outlined here:
    https://stackoverflow.com/a/49212652). PV also created images for each
    table (`img/jadwalxx.jpg`). Standard markdown links have been used to
    link to the images. Arabic characters representing a number  (or points
    on a line in geometrical explanations) are overlined in the manuscript
    and tagged as `<u class="num">` in the transliteration;  PV has tagged
    these characters with a `@NUM@` tag.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
