90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was edited together with Ibn Bābawayh's
        Thawāb al-aʿmāl; PV separated these two texts (see
        0381IbnBabawayh.ThawabAcmal.Shia001138BK1-ara1) 1- HRH used a different
        edition for collation. This edition has a few extra titles ("bāb"). HRH
        indicated them with blank headers since they are useful for the
        structure of the text.  2- Two other editions of the text that are
        accessible on the internet can be found here:
        http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2100 and
        http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2542.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
