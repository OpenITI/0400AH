90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Shamla version lacked the third volume, so I
    copied it from the Shia version which is exactly the same edition (with
    Maxim’s permission). I also did this for PageV02P593-608 that were
    missing in Shamela version. 2- The text did not have any automatic tags
    except a few unnecessary ones. 3- The first volume has a descriptive
    table of contents which cannot be used for annotation. However, it might
    be helpful for understanding the structure of the text. 4- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
