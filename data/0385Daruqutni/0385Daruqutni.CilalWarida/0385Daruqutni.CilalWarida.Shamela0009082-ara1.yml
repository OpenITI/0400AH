90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book has a lot of sections (“جزء”) that do not have any effect on the structure of the text. So, I didn’t tag them. 2- Some volumes have descriptive table of contents which are useful to understand the structure of the text (because in most volumes the existing titles do not cover the whole subjects under discussion); however it cannot be used for structural tagging. 3- Some editorial sections are the notes of the scribe.
